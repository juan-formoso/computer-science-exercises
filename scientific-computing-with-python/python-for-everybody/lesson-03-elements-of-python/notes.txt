ELEMENTS OF PYTHON

1. Vocabulary / Words - Variables and Reserved word
2. Sentence structure - valid syntax patterns
3. Story structure - constructing a program for a purpose

RESERVED Words

* You cannot use reserved words as variables names / identifiers
  - False
  - None
  - True
  - and
  - as
  - assert
  - break
  - class
  - if
  - def
  - del
  - elif
  - else
  - except
  - return
  - for
  - from
  - global
  - try
  - import
  - in
  - is
  - lambda
  - while
  - not 
  - or
  - pass
  - raise
  - finally
  - continue
  - nonlocal
  - with
  - yield 

SENTENCES OR LINES

x = 2 <-- Assignment statement
x = x + 2 <-- Assignment with expression
print(x) <-- Print statement

PYTHON SCRIPTS

* Interactive Python is good for experiments and programs of 3-4 lines long.
* Most programs are much longer, so we type them into a file and tell Python to run the commands in the file.
* In a sense, we are "giving Python a script".
* As a convention, we add ".py" as the suffix on the end of these files to indicate they contain Python.

PROGRAMS STEPS OR PROGRAM FLOW

* Like a recipe or installation instructions, a program is a sequence of steps to be done in order.
* Some steps are conditional - they may be skipped.
* Sometimes a step or group of steps is to be repeated.
* Sometimes we store a set of steps to be used over and over as needed several places throughout the program.
